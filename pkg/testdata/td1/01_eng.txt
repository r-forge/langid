WHEN the notion of global warming first seeped into public consciousness in the 1980s, business took a dim view of it. Admitting that human activity was changing the climate would involve accepting some responsibility, which was likely to mean coughing up cash. So, in 1989, shortly after the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body set up under UN auspices to establish a scientific consensus on the issue, the big carbon emitters set up the Global Climate Coalition (GCC). It cast doubt on the science and campaigned against greenhouse-gas reductions. 
The GCC folded in 2002. Its line of argument enjoyed a final flowering last year, in a startlingly inane television commercial put out by the business-funded Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI). It showed pictures of trees (breathing in carbon dioxide) and a happy little girl blowing dandelion seeds (breathing out carbon dioxide). The punchline was: “Carbon dioxide: they call it pollution; we call it life.”
These days very few serious businessmen will say publicly either that climate change is not happening or that it is not worth tackling. Even Exxon Mobil, bête noire of the climate-change activists, has now withdrawn funding from the CEI and appears to accept the need for controls on carbon emissions.
Businesses in every sector boast about their greenness. Annual reports elaborate on investments to offset companies' emissions. Of course the companies that do this tend to be those with few emissions, such as banks and retailers. Some oil companies do it too, but they offset only the greenhouse gases that they emit in producing petrol, not the emissions from the petrol itself. Power generators, which emit CO2 on a huge scale, do not do it. 
Yet the corporate world's sudden conversion to greenery is not just fluff. Big emitters are beginning to price carbon into their investment plans, and to alter them accordingly. As a result, wind and solar energy are getting an enormous boost, the price of electricity produced from renewable sources is dropping fast and a flurry of projects to sequester carbon emissions from power generation is beginning to get under way. On the transport side, money is flowing into biofuels and electric cars.
Energy has become the hot new area for venture capitalists and universities. MIT's president, Susan Hockfield, has started an “energy initiative” to promote research into alternative sources, storage and cleaning up conventional sources; and student enrolment into energy-related courses has tripled over the past five years. In 2003, the most recent year for which figures are available, America's power-generation industry spent less on R&D as a proportion of turnover than did the country's pet-food industry, which suggests there is scope for more investment.
What is driving this shift towards cleaner energy? First, moral pressure. Thanks to a potent combination of science, Hurricane Katrina, a heatwave in Europe, Al Gore's admonitions and starving polar bears, the fight against global warming has acquired the force of a religion enhanced by celebrity endorsement. Climate change has gone from being dull and marginal to cool and core. Businessmen, like everybody else, want to be seen to be doing the right thing, and self-interest points in the same direction. Firms that seem to be on the right side of the argument have a better chance of pulling in clever, idealistic young people to work for them. 
Second, there is economic pressure. Governments increasingly accept the need to put a price on the damage carbon does, and make polluters pay that price. Fears about energy security mostly push in the same direction as those about climate change. Many governments are keen to reduce dependence on Middle Eastern and Russian oil and gas. That means encouraging energy efficiency and promoting domestic energy sources—which, aside from coal, tend to be the clean sort, such as solar, wind and biomass.
Europe already puts a price on carbon, through its Emissions-Trading System. The chances of a similar scheme being adopted in America rise with every passing hurricane. There is a plethora of subsidies on both sides of the Atlantic for clean-energy alternatives. Direct controls on emissions, for instance through vehicle fuel-efficiency standards, are being tightened around the
