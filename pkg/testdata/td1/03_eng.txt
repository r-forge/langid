In the days when the spinning-wheels hummed busily in the
farmhouses - and even great ladies, clothed in silk and
thread lace, had their toy spinning-wheels of polished oak -
there might be seen in districts far away among the lanes,
or deep in the bosom of the hills, certain pallid undersized
men, who, by the side of the brawny country-folk, looked
like the remnants of a disinherited race.  The shepherd's dog
barked fiercely when one of these alien-looking men
appeared on the upland, dark against the early winter sunset;
for what dog likes a figure bent under a heavy bag? -
and these pale men rarely stirred abroad without that
mysterious burden.  The shepherd himself, though he had
good reason to believe that the bag held nothing but flaxen
thread, or else the long rolls of strong linen spun from
that thread, was not quite sure that this trade of weaving,
indispensable though it was, could be carried on entirely
without the help of the Evil One.  In that far-off time
superstition clung easily round every person or thing that was at
all unwonted, or even intermittent and occasional merely,
like the visits of the pedlar or the knife-grinder.  No one
knew where wandering men had their homes or their origin;
and how was a man to be explained unless you at least knew
somebody who knew his father and mother?  To the
peasant of old times, the world outside their own direct
experience was a region of vagueness and mystery: to their
untravelled thought a state of wandering was a conception as
dim as the winter life of the swallows that came back with
the spring; and even a settler, if he came from distant parts,
hardly ever ceased to be viewed with a remnant of distrust,
which would have prevented any surprise if a long course of
inoffensive conduct on his part had ended in the commission
of a crime; especially if he had any reputation for
knowledge, or showed any skill in handicraft.  All cleverness,
whether in the rapid use of that difficult instrument the
tongue, or in some other art unfamiliar to villagers, was in
itself suspicious: honest folk, born and bred in a visible
manner, were mostly not over-wise or clever - at least, not
beyond such a matter as knowing the signs of the weather;
and the process by which rapidity and dexterity of any kind
were acquired was so wholly hidden, that they partook of the
nature of conjuring.  In this way it came to pass that those
scattered linen-weavers - emigrants from the town  into the
country - were to the last regarded as aliens by their rustic
neighbours, and usually contracted the eccentric habits
which belong to a state of loneliness.

In the early years of this century, such a linen-weaver,
named Silas Marner, worked at his vocation in a stone cottage
that stood among the nutty hedgerows near the village
of Raveloe, and not far from the edge of a deserted stone-pit.
The questionable sound of Silas's loom, so unlike the natural
cheerful trotting of the winnowing-machine, or the simpler
rhythm of the flail, had a half-fearful fascination for the
Raveloe boys, who would often leave off their nutting or
bird's-nesting to peep in at the window of the stone cottage,
counterbalancing a certain awe at the mysterious action of
the loom, by a pleasant sense of scornful superiority, drawn
from the mockery of its alternating noises, along with the
bent, tread-mill attitude of the weaver.  But sometimes it
happened that Marner, pausing to adjust an irregularity in
his thread, became aware of the small scoundrels, and,
though chary of his time, he liked their intrusion so ill that
