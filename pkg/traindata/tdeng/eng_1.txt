ENG                  PROPOSAL FOR A COUNCIL DECISION          ADOPTING THE FIRST EUROPEAN STRATEGIC PROGRAMME      FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY                            ESPRIT INTRODUCTION Eight out of ten personal computers sold in Europe are imported from the USA; nine out of ten videotape recorders sold in Europe come from Japan. European-based integrated circuit manufacturers supply 30% of their own home market and represent 13% of world production, half of which is manufactured in the USA by subsidiaries of European companies. Large mainframe computer manufacturers in Europe have, without exception, entered agreements with overseas companies in order to benefit from their technological advance. In the field of electronic data processing, office and factory automation, process control and telecommunications[1], compared to the limited number of "niches" in which Europe is performing fairly well, the list of the areas in which Europe is struggling to catch up is lengthy.  Since the post war reconstruction period Europe has lagged behind in the industrial application of many high technologies and notably electronics. Because of the increasing direct or indirect influence of electronics in practically all aspects of industrial life in the western world, what was in the past just technological dependence in a few specialized areas is now threatening to become industrial and economic dependence plain and simple. In these conditions the identity of Europe and eventually its political independence will be seriously at stake. [1]  These are the sectors broadly encompassed by the term "Information      Technology"  At a time when, on the one hand US and Japan are taking new initiatives and increasing their investments[2] to improve their technological, industrial and commercial predominence, and on the other hand the emerging economies, in Asia and the Americas, are taking over more and more of the traditional manufacturing activities, Europe cannot afford to remain an observer.  The effects of the electronic revolution, that is now taking place, will impact directly on Europe's social and economic structure regardless of whether it has an active or passive role in it. Changes offer new possibilities, but bring about alterations that are not always without problems: only those who can control the determining factors of the changes can hope to minimize the problems. Europe must therefore assume a positive role to be master of its future.  Being first in the line of fire, industry has been aware of this for some time and has tried, often assisted by its respective governments, to remedy the situation. Measures taken so far, however, have not been sufficient to reverse the trend, and by and large have only managed to slow down the deteriorating process.  The situation threatens now to get dramatically worse: our balance of payments in IT products and services, still positive in 1975, suffered a substantial deficit of US $ 5 billion in 1981 and this is believed to have doubled for 1982.  Representatives of the largest European companies active in the Information Technology field took the initiative in approaching the Commission in order to try to find a solution of a scale matching the problem. [2]  e.g.  the Japanese Government is investing US $ 500 M on the Fifth      Generation Computer Programme; in the USA the largest computer and      semiconductor manufacturers are organizing themselves to conduct R&amp;D      programmes in joint ventures, for example the Semiconductor Research      Cooperative (SRC) and the Computer Aided Manufacturing International      (CAMI).  These actions are being favoured by the US administration's      Economic Recovery Tax Act signed by President Reagan in August, 1981,      that includes R&amp;D tax credits, accelerated depreciation schedules and      other incentives which are expected to stimulate an additional      $ 3 billion in corporate R&amp;D over the next five years.  In early 1983 they jointly wrote to Vice President Davignon depicting the situation as follows : "The figures of market share, i.e.  European Industry commanding only 10% of the world market and less than 40% of its own indigeneous market, make stark reading.  Not only is the situation in itself of great concern but the low market share means that the volume of sales and profit is inadequate to provide the essential investment needed to safeguard the future.  Even worse, all the indications are that the situation is deteriorating rather than improving.
